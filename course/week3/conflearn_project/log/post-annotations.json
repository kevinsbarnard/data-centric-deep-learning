A wash-out pomade sounds like the best idea!! Reuzel Blue washes completely away. My issue is with the hold and the \"crispiness\". This is for all intents and purposes \"hair gel\", it dries hard. I really didn't like it. I won't be buying another can. I will however be buying more Reuzel Pink!\n\nOh yeah.. this stuff does indeed smell AMAZING!"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-07-28T23:37:09.888408Z","updated_at":"2024-07-28T23:50:30.888782Z","inner_id":3054,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":3532,"annotations":[{"id":12,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"data-37076","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"prediction"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-07-28T23:45:27.617256Z","updated_at":"2024-07-28T23:45:27.617295Z","draft_created_at":"2024-07-28T23:45:21.041289Z","lead_time":23.021,"prediction":{"id":3532,"model_version":"undefined","created_ago":"8 minutes","result":[{"value":{"choices":["Negative"]},"id":"data-37076","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices"}],"score":null,"cluster":null,"neighbors":null,"mislabeling":0.0,"created_at":"2024-07-28T23:37:11.393261Z","updated_at":"2024-07-28T23:37:11.393272Z","model":null,"model_run":null,"task":3532,"project":1},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"e5d64f3c-c2f0-49e1-87d1-597a58c1d6bc","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":3532,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":3532,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"e3524f0a-pre-annotations.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[3532],"data":{"text":"Only used it a few days so far. I have purchased this through several dermatologists in the past and spent lots of $$$. The main difference I notice so far is this particular bottle does not burn or sting like others on the past. The soap looks the same, the smell is the same (like johnsons baby wash). I'm just hoping it doesn't mean it won't be as effective. I was worried the glycolic % wasn't high enough or not concentrated properly. My skin looks a little clearer after 3 days...but still waiting to really notice a difference.
